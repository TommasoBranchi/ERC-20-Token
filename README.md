# ERC-20-Token

This contract is just to show you how it's simple to create an erc-20 token, but before, you have to know what's the meaning before a cryptocurrency and you have to study to know what you were creating for. I don't recommend to use this file to create a real cryptocurrenct due to possible bug in the code that i have created just for my graduation project.
